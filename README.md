# React Couteau - Barebones React Starter

I often find myself making a barebones React instance to play with ideas, new libraries, or to attempt to reproduce odd isssues.

`create-react-app` is wonderful but its vast hidden mechanisms means it's often hard to tinker with easily.

This leaves all the configuration extremely minimal and lets you persue your goals without having to google which exact `babel` packages you need with `webpack` again.

## Running Couteau

**Setup**

1. `yarn` - install dependencies

**Develeopment**

1. `yarn start` - run hot reloading webpack-dev-server

**Production**

1. `yarn build` - create production bundle

## Included

- React/React-DOM
- Webpack 4 w/ webpack-dev-server
- Babel 7 w/ JSX preset
- A single "hello" component.

## Why "Couteau"?

In cooking there's an idea that for nearly all things, you really only need a chef's knife. Knife in French is "couteau". Now you know.
